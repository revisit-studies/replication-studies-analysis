 Okay, so I'm looking at this graph about admissions rates and goes from purple to the lower end to orange on the high end. So let's look at a couple of the purple circles. I see Florida Memorial University admission rate 20%. This is 25,000 in median earnings. Okay, 20% seems a little low, but let's go to one of the orange. So the admission rate 10%. Claremont McKenna College, higher cost. And so it looks like the higher cost has lower admissions rate. Let's look at a couple more of their purples. 24% 57,000 annual cost. 23% 45. So it seems like at the lower end the purple seems like the admission rate is around 22 to 24%. This one's a little bit higher. And when we look at the orange ones, the mission's rates seems to be closer to 14% cost being higher like 60+. So looking at this, I feel like it's not real intuitive. I mean, I get it when I mouse over the different colors, but just looking at it, it's really a struggle to kind of get his overall sense of what the data is telling me.
