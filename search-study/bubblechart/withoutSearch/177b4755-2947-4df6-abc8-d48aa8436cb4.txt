 Alright, so I'll probably start by exploring the different circles and colors just getting a feel for what they represent. So the distance to the center is the admission rate. So you've got 46, 47 percent along the edges and towards the middle it declines down to about 6 percent. The lowest rating I'm seeing is Stanford with 5 percent as the admission rate. Alright, and the radius is the annual cost. So it seems like the size of the individual circles indicates the cost. So the smaller circles are going to be the cheaper colleges and the larger ones are going to be a little bit more expensive perhaps. And the color indicates median of earnings. So the purple is the lowest and the orange is the highest earnings. So I'm assuming that's the students because the admission rate in the annual cost has to do with students as well. So it must be the earnings of either the student or their household which would make sense right because you have tufts and vanderbilt being high up there, Boston University, Harvard, Stanford. And then the purple ones would be like sterling college or grace university or these smaller ones that seem like they're less well known. That seems like the bulk of what I'm looking at. Those are the three main categories that are being visualized. I'm not going to try to remember every college name that's present in the visualization
