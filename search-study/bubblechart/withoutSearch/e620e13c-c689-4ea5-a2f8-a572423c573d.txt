 Start exploring. Okay, fine. I'm exploring distance to mission rate, radius annual cost, color median of earnings. Okay, let's try the university of San Diego, a mission rate 46, annual cost, which is size six grand, median of earnings, 56, 57,000. Okay, yeah, toughs university. And you cost $61,000. Whoa, university of Pennsylvania. Yeah, mission rate, annual costs, median income, yeah, this is great. It's only 6.3% annual cost is $61,000, median of earning, 74,000. They take a long time to make that up. University of Notre Dame, mission rate 21, annual cost is $60,000. Median income, the earnings is only 70. I'm gonna find something that is not quite as expensive. Wow, okay. Let's try some of these. Wow. I can't believe in your cost to some of these. That's scary. I can't see that their costs just are justified for the earnings. Okay, Skidmore, No, Colby. Wow. Okay, let's try some of these. 28,000, and you're only gonna make 27, 58,000, okay. I'm finished exploring.
