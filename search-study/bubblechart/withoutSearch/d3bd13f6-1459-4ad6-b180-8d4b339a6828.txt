 page. Okay so you cannot return to this page. Okay so click the following button only after you've finished exploring. Okay so what I'm seeing here. Okay I'm clicking on a large purple circle and it's American Academy of Dramatic Arts Elos Angeles. The admission rate is 20.16% annual cost is $51,614 and the median of earnings is $27,800. I'm going to click on a lot purple. The admission rate is 44.61% annual cost is $62,572 and the median of earnings is $38,700. I am wondering if that's okay. So when I click when I seems like the lot purples have higher. Well no not all of them because I click on another large purple and it's 40.38% annual cost is 58. Medium of earnings is 30,000. I'm going to do a large orange one. Wow the admission rate is for Stanford is only 5.09% annual cost is $60,311. The median of earnings is 86. I wonder if all of these are that way for the large orange circles. No dark milk college is only 11.5. So now I'm going to click on a large black orange circle. Okay.
