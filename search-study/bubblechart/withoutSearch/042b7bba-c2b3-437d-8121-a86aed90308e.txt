 Okay, so, mouse away, any of the electrical certificates, your task is to analyze the data test set of college information and describe the findings identified in the next page. Mouse away, any of the electrical certificates, okay, so these circles, Bible college, mission rate, 39% and it'll cost $25,000, earning $31,000. And across our earnings, okay. Vanuilate University, 13% rate, 14% rate for Bowdoin College, musical dramatic arts, 23% rate, Oakland College, 32% rate, New York University, 35% rate. Let's see, Whitman College is 41% rate, so right now we're looking at the median of earnings. Distance to center, okay, this is kind of confusing, though. Distance to center, administration rate, radius. Oh, so the administration rate is the closest is the least amount and the furthest way is the highest amount, gotcha. Radius is the annual cost. So 31, so around here is 28,000 is the annual cost and as you go down there it's 6,000, as you go into the middle it's 64,000 and the color median is the, how much of earnings. So this one is 34 to gotcha, okay. So the most expensive is out, most expensive is around the perimeter, the emission rate. The lowest measure is for the middle and the color is the earnings. All right, okay. Okay.
