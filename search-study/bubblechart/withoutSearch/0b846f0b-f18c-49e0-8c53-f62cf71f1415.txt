Just to center, I have mission rate, mission rate percentages, the annual costs of guessing are going to the university and the meeting of our earnings, guessing is what graduates will earn. This is so, You have bigger well-known universities in the middle, and Yale stands for Brown University Chicago Columbia Duke with Western Massachusetts MIT, I mean the center which would make sense that they have higher median of earning according to the color scale and then towards the outside you have, what do you have, I guess, a little bit more purple or towards the lower end of median of earnings. And then you have the lowest of the earnings which is the dark purple, 33,000 small colleges. I'm guessing the circle stands the size of the circle stands for the size of the school maybe, because you also have small orange circles but with pretty high median earnings.
