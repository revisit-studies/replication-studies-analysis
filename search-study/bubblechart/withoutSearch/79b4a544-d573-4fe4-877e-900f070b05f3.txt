 It's been all that the Milky Way plays in a kind of part of solx, it's an awful lot of jelly in some sense. Yes, but things that these two and these two are reacting with, is the Hollywood between this world and the other world. The motion of a leap to the heavens to the Milky Way and the journey that is made after death is very strong amongst the Maya. What's remarkable is how white's red this notion is. This Milky Way symbolism as a part of solx is found not just amongst the Maya, but there are many other cultures involved in that.
