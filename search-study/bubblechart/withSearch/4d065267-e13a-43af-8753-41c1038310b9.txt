 Alright, I'm looking at this data set. My task is to analyze, describe the findings you identified, mouse over, use text box. What exactly am I supposed to be analyzing? I assume that I would be analyzing who has the largest median income. So I guess I would scroll over, I guess, I start with Harvard, which seems to be the height on the higher end with 59,000 annual cost and earnings of 95,000. And then I can go look at one of these smaller ones. For example, like the Pacific Union, which has annual cost 39,000 median 45K earnings, which is something that, which is, I think that's more than half, or less than half.
