 Okay, so, not so much in this type of technique. So nice рез, just two eggs, Middle and Summertime... Let's see, yo! College College 61,000 and the median of the earnings is 74,700. I'll see here. Wait for us college. So they have a 34% admission rate. They will cost us a little like 60,000. But the earnings is, you know, I mean, you get less earnings than you actually, you get even worth 1 to wait for us. I'm going to show them a scholarship. I'll say what this is. University of San Diego. Make sure it is 46%. Like in the annual cost of the more than worth of person. More than what the average person makes, which is really crazy. So this one is an April's official rate. Annual cost of 64,000 dollars. Maybe an earning is 64,000. So again, the college costs more than the average people make. It's really crazy. Okay, let's see. I'm reading college 38% admission rate. New York, college is 47,000 dollars. Meaning the earnings is 3,000. That's that what man. I thought that was read. Read college. Read college is 59,000. But the median early is only 75,000. So I'm taking it mostly with the missionaries. There's a man way off of college ships. It's crazy.
