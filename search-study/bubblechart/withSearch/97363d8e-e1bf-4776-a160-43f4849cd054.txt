But the light purple ones also are kind of like that. Like see that there are some purples that like the deep purples that have lower emission rates than the lighter purple ones. I guess it really depends. But I can see that there's like the Juilliard School for example has lower emission rate and it's purple. But like the cost is like really high. So that's kind of why it's so big. There's like one purple that's in like near the middle. It's over the big. But like it has high emission rate but the annual cost is so kind of yucky. That's what I'm observing.
