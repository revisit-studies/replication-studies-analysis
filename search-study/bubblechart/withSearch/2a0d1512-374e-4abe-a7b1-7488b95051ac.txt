 All right, so my task is to analyze this data set of college information, describe the findings you identified in the next page. So of course, the higher the annual cost, the lower the admission rate, that makes sense. And then the earnings, whoo, not exactly correlating with the cost too well, are they? I like Warner University, 26% admission rate, annual cost of 29,323. But median earnings of 40,300. Versus the Lane University, 61,000 annual cost, 52,900 for median earnings. Very interesting.
