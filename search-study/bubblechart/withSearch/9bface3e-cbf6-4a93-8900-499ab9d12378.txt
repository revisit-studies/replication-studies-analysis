 Okay. Brown University admission rate, G, 8.74, and you cost 60,000 median of earnings. So I know that I would never be accepted to this school. I do not have the GPA nor I feel they would want me in general. The cost I yearly costs is so much it is almost double of my undergrad yearly cost. And I am still having trouble paying off of it. Medium of earnings, that is more than what I make now. Yeah, I would not be able to afford it nor do I think they would want me as well. Okay. So, a jewelry art school. Oh, wow. Okay. So, admission rate is still around the same, 8.43. I do not have to tell it or I know I would not be applying or would they want to accept me. And your cost it is 55k. But what caught my eyes, but now I understand is the median of earnings is only 29,000. You know, the actors when they're just starting out, they do not get paid a lot or when they're trying to look for jobs, they do not get paid a lot. So, it makes sense that the median of earnings is at 29k.
