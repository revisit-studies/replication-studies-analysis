That's way too high to be earnings of the students. Maybe it's the earnings of the... The earnings of the school. That doesn't make sense either. It couldn't be earnings of the parents because, well, 28, that would be too low. The earnings of the graduates probably. That would make the most sense. Like median earnings of... Yeah, I think that's probably the one. So basically how much you are paying and how much you're going to be making when you leave. That would be my assumption based on this. The orange circle schools. You're going to be the higher cost. It looks like the highest expensive attendance. The purple will be the lowest cost of attendance. And then the... between the light purple would be kind of in the middle there. It would be nice to see the... Yeah, just the kind of like the ratio there.
