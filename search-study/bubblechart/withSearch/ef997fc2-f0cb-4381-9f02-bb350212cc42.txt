 There it is. This is a salad. Come on, be out here and let's get there. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Where is the... Harvard. Harvard University. Harvard University. Harvard University. Okay. Harvard University. Harvard again. I will throw some of these universities. They are ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 years. Very steep. But then I've noticed even like with Columbia 64,000 but they only have a 6.9% admission rate. Interesting in the medium earnings of 75,000. I've done a school that's close to us. University of Chicago. And that university has eight admission rates. 64,000 annual calls. But there are only 64,000. It's very interesting. I've looked at smaller schools. Want to Mississippi. Earning what's like admissions was in the 13,000. So it's really interesting to look at these different ranges of schools. Wow. I noticed this warm central Christian college at the Bible. The annual calls only 24,000. But it had some administration rate of 42%. That's very interesting. It's a very interesting thing to look at. So I'm not done.
