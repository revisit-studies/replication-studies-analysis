 Okay. Um, task identified analyze the data set of college information and describe the findings you identify in the next page. Also, we're any of the circles to obtain detailed view. Okay. So distance to center information rate. Okay. We're going to search for a college. We'll say Penn State. Penn State. Okay. Wait, search for college. Oh, I see. I've got to click on that. The University of Pennsylvania. Mission rate, 10.3% annual cost, $61,000. Need to earn $79,70. I'm like, I can't. Okay. So I'm looking at I'm bouncing over the different circles. 13,000. Okay. It's it's not median annual cost. This is really a confusing chart, double chart. I mean, they're just I'm trying to figure out how they're organized. And so the smallest SCI was going to say that the color doesn't have any to do with the circle size. I see the admission rate 8.76. Mission rate 16. So the size of the circle has nothing to do with the admission rate. Okay. The smaller the circle, the higher the admission rate. Okay. So the smaller the smaller the amount, I would think that the higher admission rate would be, would make it a bigger circle. Looking at Catholic Church Puerto Rico, high admission rate, low cost. This chart does not make any sense to me. I mean, I see what it's doing is telling me the admission rate, the cost and the median earning for each one of these colleges. But I don't know why it's just a helter's shelter. I think that's kind of a silly way of displaying it. So, come on then.
