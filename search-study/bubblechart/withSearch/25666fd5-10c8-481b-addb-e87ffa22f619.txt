 All right, what we have here we have first of let's look at the key, a legend, this class to Center Admissionary Passage and our cost, median of earnings. Your task is to analyze this dataset of public information and describe to find this identified in the next page. Mouse over any of the circles, opportunity, tell me, use the text box and it's up to such for a specific college. Your address, you recorded in this page, please verbalize your top process, ask your analyze, okay, I think I will use my mouse. Click the following button on after you finish exploring color return to this page. All right, I'll go for 57k and above Boston University admission return, it's 4%, and we're cost 61,396, median earnings, 59,000. Okay, let's see how much there seems to be any corn mix of the different levels of costume and earnings. Columbia is right there, so which ones are the top? We have 57,056,000, another bottom, still 58,50. So this is quite symmetrical, it doesn't actually, the differences is in the colors. Let's see, have a ton of colors. The median is less than 57,000. So that's the pale orange color. We have 56,000, so it falls within this range. Okay, let me check out more. median earnings is 51,000. Okay, let's see if we can find any that's out of range. median earnings for kinetic cut is 51,000 for hemp, hemp, then Sydney College is 49,000, 53,000 for Dickinson College. Okay, let me explore more in the highest median earnings rate. Also, that college is, we have, absent college, in 6,000, wow, that's quite high. California Institute of Technology, College is 77,000, 56,000, median earnings, I need the deep orange ones, 58,000, 76,000, 80,000, 66,000. Okay, now let's look at the median earnings in the range of 34,000 to 47,000. That's the, oh, pistol, looks like a lilac, or purple, very, very pistol shade of purple. So we have 38,000. What do we have here for the 6,000 still within range? 34,000 for Texas, and then, Cleveland Institute of Music is 38,000. And finally, let's look at the median earnings in the range of 13,000 to 34,000, and Wally, which is the deep purple. I always, West, West, lay in universities study 3000, scared more college is 43,000. That's out of range. median earnings of 43,000 is should not be, oh, okay, I'm looking at the wrong page, but I'm looking at a pistol, purple, okay, back to the deep purple, 27,000, Lincoln, Christian, REST, 27,000, Sterling College, 30,000. Okay, it's a very interesting, we'll visualize in data. It's clustered, and I guess the size, I can't tell why some are smaller, and some are larger, maybe it's the percentages, that it takes the size, let me see. Nope, actually not. Okay, that said, I'm finished.
