 So, I'm actually not familiar with a lot of colleges. So this is actually pretty cool. So the median of earnings I'm assuming is the median of earnings for the students and not the university, obviously. I currently attend MIT. median of earnings is $89,000. I don't even make a quarter of that. Wow. I didn't know that the rate of Harvard was only 5% that's very interesting. I'm guessing that these are all IVs. So, all university Chicago cheeses. Interesting. So these are like very prestigious colleges. Letting them Northwestern was so low. Those are very interesting. Or these turn. I don't remember what state that one was in. So, I mean, there's definitely not like the biggest correlation between median earnings and annual cost. I feel like they're, they look similar, but even like the most, even the most prestigious colleges have like around where I thought. I thought it would be more like six figures for those ones. I thought that's at $659,000. Definitely was wrong about that. I've not heard of many of these. I wonder what the, you know, for the smaller dots here that are not as prestigious, they have like 50% rate of acceptance. I wonder if these are from like the acceptance rates are more local instead of, you know, worldwide event. It's very interesting. Wow, I didn't know A&M was so cheap. I shoulda went there.
