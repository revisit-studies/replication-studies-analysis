 It's interesting. The following button only after you finish exploring. No blurry. Test is the analyzed data set of college information in the script finding you identified. This is interesting. I'm not sure... I don't even know what. What is supposed to do here? Just analyze it. I mean, it's an interesting little bubble. So we got color medium and attorneys. Oh, I'm gonna call it the 60. I'm gonna call it the 60. It's interesting to say the least. I would want to... Find a college this way. There's like three sizes or four sizes of bubbles. So it's hard to get the pattern. You can text box at the top to search for specific audio is recorded. Please remember. I mean, it's interesting to say the least. You see the meaning of earnings there for the colors. The sizes and guesses. The sizes of these bubbles are... Oh, emission rate 34, 43. Oh, no, it's another emission rate. Annual cost 64. I see. So it looks like the cheaper ones are the smaller bubbles. Yeah, okay. Okay, interesting. Well, it makes sense to me now. So it's still a very interesting way to analyze it. Analyze colleges to me. It's interesting. I'm not even sure what to think. It's a little chaotic. It's a... an extremely large amount of information in a very small, busy circle. So... Yeah, it's a little chaotic to me. So I'm not... It's not something I would want to look for college just through. This is very interesting. Yeah, it's interesting. I'm not sure. It's busy. I don't even know what else to say, but it's very, very busy. Busy, busy. Smaller ones are... The lower annual costs. Those are the larger... Maybe the burnings. So that's interesting. I mean, it makes sense. I see the pattern. But it's very busy to my eyes. I wouldn't want to... I wouldn't want to look for a college with this method. It's just busy. It's too much. It's too much.
