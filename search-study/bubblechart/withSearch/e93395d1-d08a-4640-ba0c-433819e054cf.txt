Some of these smaller ones, 21%, 22,000. 28%. 47%, 17,000. I wonder are these all public universities or some of these private? Clayton State, Stimula, Sick. It looks like some of the ones with higher admission rates may have lower prices, maybe. 47%, 57%. Yeah, so that's the lower admission, but higher cost. Wow. That one is immensely cheap, 10,000. Wow. 13,000 to 8%. I mean, some of these are still relatively low admission rate and still pretty low cost. Okay. 25, 22,
