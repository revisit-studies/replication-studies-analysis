 Okay, well I'm looking at all these. Now I will click on one of them. Columbia University, I see a bunch of colleges as I hover over. I'm going to click on Art Academy. I showed all the details, that's the cost. The median of earnings and mission rate, 29% 30%. Versaire Rochester is 36%. It all looks pretty detailed. I can see the visualization pretty good. All the circles, good color, pretty bold colors.
