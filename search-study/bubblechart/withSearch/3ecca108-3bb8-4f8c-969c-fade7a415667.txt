 Okay, so we can... So there's no question to answer, though, right? Click the following button only after you've finished exploring. So we want to explore... Okay, so what does it say? Washington and Jefferson College admission rates Annual cost, medium of earnings. Okay, distance to center. So admission rate... So this is medium of earnings, annual cost. The radius of annual costs and then the admission rate. So up here I would put in the information. I would search for school. Is that what... So let's put in Yale. Okay, so Yale University. Oh, that's good. And it will show me just that. Okay, so reset the search. So the orange is the most expensive. And the purple is the least medium earnings. And then it goes dark orange, light orange, light purple, dark purple. So it's interesting. It says your task is to analyze this data set of college information and describe the findings you identified in the next page. Okay, so it's laid out. I'm a little confused as to what you want me to answer here. So the orange... Do the sizes? Oh, the radius. Okay, the distance to the center. Okay, so the ones at the center of this have the lowest admissions rate. The ones farthest away have the highest rates. The radius of each circle notes how expensive the cost is. And the color indicates how much medium... Is it potential medium earnings you can get or people have? I'm guessing it's probably what people have when they go there. So we want the largest circle, the largest... Look at this, University of San Diego. Right out here on the edge, we got these big circles. Easy to get into. Oh, wait. No. We want tiny circles. Tiny. Dark orange circles right there. Brigham Young. Large admission rate. Lower annual cost. Bigger medium. Medium income. Earnings. Oh, that's kind of interesting. So what dark purple would be... So easy to get into dark purple. Okay, so we don't want dark purple. We want the highest median earnings. The annual cost. We want to be tiny. We want tiny little... Oh, look at that. Right there. $10,000. And the median income is the distance... Oh, admission rates. It's from the distance of the center. And then the medium earnings. Oh, that's actually very clever. Okay, so... Let's go to...
