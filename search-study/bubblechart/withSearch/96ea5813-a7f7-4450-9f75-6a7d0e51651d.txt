The University of Rochester, the admission rate of 36.41%, annual cost of $61,340, a median of 6,000, then we have Hobart William, Smith College, admission rate of $7.53% an annual cost of $59,850, a median of $6,000, an annual cost of $86,000, a median of an annual cost of $8,600, we have 60,000, 311, a median of 1,000 at 86,000. And we have the University of Chicago at 8.7, 6% admission rate, the annual cost of 64,900, 64,900 and $88, a median of 1,000 at 64,000. And I like the same cost, the median of 1,000 at the same. Right.
