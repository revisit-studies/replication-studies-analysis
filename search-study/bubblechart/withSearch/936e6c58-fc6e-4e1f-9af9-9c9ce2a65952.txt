 All right. So analyzing the data sets, let's see. So we have admission rate and annual cost and median of earnings. So we can't click. So color median of earnings. So the color shows the median of earnings. So if we go to a high one, MIT, low admission rate, high annual cost, high median of earnings, yeah, definitely. So to assume this is median of earnings of the graduates, it kind of is unclear. Median of earnings per graduate. So like the annual cost and the median of earnings, it's these, there's only one Illinois school. What about Wisconsin? No Wisconsin schools. Oh, there's a lot of California schools. So this website is a very limited data set. New York, couple of Chicago, Chicago state, obviously. It's going to be a lot lower. University of Chicago, I'm surprised the median earnings aren't higher. I'm surprised they're not what these other schools are. Maybe because Illinois has a lower cost of living and people go to the University of Chicago living Illinois and these people that go to like, high-ve league schools on the East Coast and even some California schools will be making more money. Interesting. Here in Northwestern is a similar median of earnings. Finlandia, that's interesting. New Orleans, yeah, it's gonna be low. Arkansas. There's a lot of Southern schools that have the low median of earnings. Yeah, definitely. Another Southern school low median of earnings. That tech institute, that's interesting. Here's a diverse array of schools here. And these high median of earning schools have low median mission rates. Oh, Julia, that's interesting. Low admission rate, but it's music, so people are making less. Yeah, it's really interesting.
