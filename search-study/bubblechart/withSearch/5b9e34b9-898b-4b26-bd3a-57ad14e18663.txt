 Let's see. Mission rate 46.25% annual cost 57,000 median earnings 56,000. Okay. The Glenville State College. Okay. University of Maryland College Park, admission rate 47.93. 23,000 for the annual cost, median earnings 60,500. So the Hope Barth Williamson College, 47.53, 59,850, and 48,600. Okay. We have Bentley University at 46,11. Annual cost 56,000 median earnings 76,000. John C. Smith University, admission rate 42,000. I mean, if I'm missing right 42%, annual cost 31,000 median earnings 30,000. Cause, well, college, college, well. 43% annual cost 28,968 median earnings 52,000. Wow. So that's actually really good. You seeing that? So it costs 28,000 by your earning 52,000. So that's Cogsville College. We've conquered university is 13,000. You can earn 32,000. That's really good too. Acceptance raise admission rate 37%. So we have a lot of these orange ones here right in the center. They're corn, well, brown, Stanford, Harvard. Oh, you see that? All the big university. Okay. So we got Stanford, Harvard. Look at the admission rate. They're 5%, 59,000, but you earn 80 to 90 grand coming out. Here's Yale 6%, 61,074,000. Wow. Here's Notre Dame. And then, you know, that's in the center. Then along the outside, this kind of outer circle of lighter orange. And these are some university without amas. We have some Haverford, Carlton, it's fourth more Cooper Union, the advancement of science and art. That sounds cool. And these ones have a little bit of higher acceptance rate. You can see 10, 20% higher. You do make a little less coming out though. Seems to be cheaper though. Seems to be about the same price as the dark orange circles. So the light orange is about the same price. It's dark orange. You just earn less in the acceptance rate. About 10 to 20% higher. Okay, see these purple ones. See that? So in the dark little purple squares, the admission rates around 20 to 30%, it cost around 30K is what I'm seeing. 40 to 30, 30 to 40. 20 to 40. Acceptance rate, steady around 20,000 to 30,000. I mean, 30%. And that's the kind of a broader circle around that. There's a little bit more of those. And then we'll go to the light gray. Let's see. You see that? So the actual 13K. So in according to the radius, their annual cost is more or less. Then you have the colors, the median of earnings, and you have the distance to the center. So you check, look at Yale. 6.7, 6.3, except admission rate. Go all the way to the edge. Amission rate 47.53, 47.64. So it looks like 47 is the cap. We'll say 47. Okay.
