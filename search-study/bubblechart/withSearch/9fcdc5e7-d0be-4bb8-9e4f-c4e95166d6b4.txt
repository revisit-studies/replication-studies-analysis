 Okay, let's see, I've got Boston University, Lafayette College. I guess nothing happens when I click on it. Harvard University. I'm going to see if my schools are on here. University. Texas. I guess it doesn't care about that. I'll just do this one then. Oh, that's interesting. Distance to center. A mission rate in no cost. Median of earnings. So, where's it? It's weird. It seems like it should highlight it or something, but oh, there it is. So, this is University of Texas. Okay, that's cool. And then I don't have to try to figure out what the code means. 39.66. Wow, it has gotten harder to get in. 25,000 a year. I don't know what median of earnings means. Is that like the kid's parents or like once they graduate or what they're making while they're in school? I'm just curious. Okay. Highly doubt community colleges are on here, but. It's not on there. That's not. So, this must be like only larger universities or all of Texas A&M. International. I don't know what that is. I honestly, when did they change it to international university? Now they're going to be really insufferable. Where is it? Okay, so that one I really can't find. Where is it? I don't know. What about rice? Well, there's that one. It's a big old orange. 15.1%. I don't know. Was that hard to get into? Okay. Well, I don't know what's wrong with the Texas A&M one, because I can't seem to find. Let's put an an an. Maybe that one's defective. I could just look around, try to run into something I was interested in. These little bitty guys. What are these? I just wonder what exactly kind of universities are on here, because I can't seem to find several, but. Who knows. It's been so long since I was in college for real that they might have changed the name. I just wanted to pull up an M so I could make fun of it. Let's try. I don't know why University of Texas or Canada A&M is on here, but I can't find. Well, that don't work again. I can't find the like UTSA University of Texas at San 20. It's weird, maybe all the A&M ones don't work. I'm just thinking one more I wanted to try. If I just put in the note that doesn't work either. I mean, San Marques, I'm new. That's not. That's not. That's not. That's Cal Poly. I guess it doesn't go for abbreviations either. Oh, well that narrows it down. That's a little bitty guy. Oh, that's funny. I'm going to put all of Texas and see what comes up. That's not work. Oh, really. I don't know. It's problem is. I guess some of these I guess is just not working. Okay, well, there's Cal Poly. This doesn't seem to have any issue. Huh, okay, that's interesting. I'm going to look at that. That's a very dim orange. I don't know. Okay.
