 Okay, so let's see here. So each little dot represents university and each color on the key represents the median of earnings. The distance to center is the admission rate percentage with the lower admission rates towards the middle. Let's see here. We're going to look up Duke University and we see that they have median earnings of 76 or 76, $1,700. You know, cost is 61,748 and the admission rate is 11.1. Let's see. Let's look up UNC or University of North Carolina. Let's look at that. Oh, and that's over here. So that one has a slightly higher, well, almost double admission rate, 28.5, median earnings, 51,000 dollars and you'll cost 23,978 dollars. Let's go look up University of Oregon. Let's see. Let's see. Looks like mostly, maybe it's mostly East Coast colleges. No, because there's California colleges. Let's see. Maybe now the Pacific Northwest. It's okay. Let's see. What if we look up University of Michigan? They're over here and they're at 32.24% admission rate. It'll cost at 26,194,3, median earnings of 57,440. I'm just going to hover over a few of these here. In the middle, we have some pretty well-known colleges. We have Harvard, Stanford, Yale, MIT, and Julia, of course, as well. Julia, it is an interesting standout because it's an art school. And so the earnings are a lot lower than other schools in this more central area. Harvard, for example, Stanford, Yale, Columbia. I am surprised that College of the Ozarks has such a low admission rate. It's pretty interesting to me, especially because it's not a very high-cost university compared to a lot of these other ones. And it's actually interesting to see how something like Southern University of New Orleans that's only 10,300 a year. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and click on the next one.
