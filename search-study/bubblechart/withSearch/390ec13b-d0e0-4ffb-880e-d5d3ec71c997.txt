 Okay, so I'm hovering over an orange circle right now. I believe it says Tufts University. So if I miss pronounced it and I see the admission rate, the percentage, the annual cost, the dollar amount and the median of earnings. So I'm just hovering over different ones. And I'm also looking at the information to the top right, the scale. And I like that the information is combined and organized. I see a lot of orange and I'm wondering, okay, with the orange, I noticed that 57K or higher, I believe. It seems like that's the majority of it, a large part of it. And let's see here, Brown University, yeah, University of Chicago. And then I'm looking at the other circles. I'm at mission rate 37%. Okay. And I'm also seeing is there like a relation to or relationship with the orange circles and the admission rate. And if the orange circles are better with the admission rate, but it doesn't seem like that's the case. It seems like with the admission rate for the orange circles, it's lower than the other ones. So I'm thinking maybe it might be harder to get into the ones with the orange. Maybe that maybe they're more selective. And then I'm seeing with the median earnings of 37K, the admission rate went a little higher. So I'm thinking maybe the lower the earnings, the higher the admission rate, I'm guessing. And I think that's pretty much what I'm gathering from this. I'm just going to use a search function really quickly, see what that gives me. And okay, so I saw what that does. Okay, that's pretty much it for this portion. I'm going to go ahead and continue.
