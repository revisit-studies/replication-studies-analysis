 Hello? Oh. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I am researching overall different colleges. Looks like, let's see. So this shows all the different colleges, the admission rate, annual cost, and median of earnings. So obviously the larger is the more expensive. So Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, let's look at Stanford specifically. So it looks like Stanford is one of the more expensive annual cost colleges, and its median earnings is about 86,000. But let's say we look at a smaller school like Glenville State College. So the administration rates 46%, annual cost is 20,000, so significantly less. But also that comes with limited median earnings. So I would assume basing this off of the lower the admission rate, the typically higher cost, and also the higher earnings. So some of these other smaller schools as a easier admission rate, but the cost is less.
