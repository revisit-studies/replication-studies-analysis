 Okay, my task is to analyze this data set of course information and scrap the findings I identify in the next page. Oh, the most over 8-year circles, so I'm trying to detail here. Okay, as it takes months, I don't talk to such a specific village. I'm built in the first city, little very college, tough in the first city. This is here. Okay, let me show you the 6.3% okay, I have a cost of $60. Okay, that's why the color. Okay, let's see, what's your last economy of Cincinnati? So from this and the kids, I'm guessing that it should be less than 13K for the tuition. Okay, now I'm a bit confused. Oh, the media. Okay, okay, let's see. The rest of the city of West Florida doesn't seem to be available here. Okay, I'm going to let you write that down. Oh, you've already got West Florida doesn't really come up here. I want is less than 34K. I'm not sure on the list that 34K does not reach it rates. Okay, let me try that again. First, you have West Florida. Maybe I should write that down so I don't forget. I guess I'll do my products. I think I just have the medical call. If I'm purely doing precious, I'm going to raise it. Okay, let's see, I'll less come Pacific University. And this is 47K median range. We don't have insurance or percent of assets, not a part. So right after that, one thing I've noticed is that colleges and universities wait the orange color. I mean, like, those are way, I guess deep orange. Those are way above 57K. The admission rates seem to be less like reaching the center of this whole circle. Once you go outside, the admission rates tend to increase. And then we have a concentration of, we have a concentration of higher cost rate, universities, limit low. Compared to those with like, median, with like, lower, median of earnings. So I guess that's it. Yeah, I guess I can go to the next page now.
