 Task can 2013-5 years after the end of the great recession of the great recession. The economy had finally regained 9 million jobs at lost. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. Task is to analyze this data set on the economy, I think, on the economy, from a popular news website, mouse over an individual line to bring up a more detailed chart, type in at the search bar to search industry. Oil and gas extraction. One common is that it's so large that you'd have to keep scrolling for the top and the bottom ones. Nail salons. Okay, search for the industry. Resale. Okay. I don't see any for that. Let's type another industry. Tudoring. No. Okay. What else? Let's try something a lot more generic. I'm in pavement. No. Okay. Huh. I don't seem like the search works unless you're searching for something that's already decided you wanted to search for. Well, let's see what else, type of industry. Let's put something really today. Long care. No. Okay. Yeah, I hate this search bar. It's not doing anything that I wanted to do. And it seems like you have to know already what how somebody else has decided to ask for something. So that seems like a real weakness to me about the search bar. Yeah, I'm trying to search for things without seeing the line like I would in real life. I wouldn't search all these lines to find out what I wanted. I would go to the search bar immediately. It really feels like this search bar cannot even send you to things that are close to what you're talking about. So that would be a huge red flag to me if I were working on this site. The search has got to be a lot more nuanced and a lot more comprehensive, in my opinion. Let's try dollar stores. Okay. Of course not. Discount stores. No. Wow. Huh. Good grief. Pet groomers. Let's try that. No. All right. I really don't like this search bar. I would never use this if I could possibly help it. I'd go to some other kind of technology like AI instead of this. This search is so limited and the vocabulary search seems not very functional or not functional for what I want to look up. And I'm trying to be generic now after I was trying to be what I was really interested in before. Uh, we'll see what kind of industry pet care pet pet pet supplies. Let's try that. Missilaneous retailers, art dealers, pet stores and art dealers. Okay. Missilaneous retailers. No, I don't want Missilaneous. I want pet stores, not art dealers. How about pet stores? Okay. Wow. Uh, pet supplies. No. Um, pet boarding and grooming. That's not what I wanted. Uh, yeah, I, I would not use this in real life. There's just no way to search for what I want to get close to what I want. And you just have to go over these and see how somebody else decided it ought to be phrased instead of the way I would phrase it because the search is so limited. Um, your net publishing broadcasting. Also, these are huge categories to group together sometimes. Uh, what if you want electronic shopping and electronic? You don't you mean online? Let's see if online shopping comes up. And how about online shopping? Okay. Yeah, I would not use this in real life. There's no way to find what you want without rolling over it and seeing how awkwardly somebody else phrased what you want to find or exactly how they phrased it. So yeah. Uh, change for the industry task is to analyze the data set on economy on the economy from a popular news website. Yeah. Uh, the session accelerated decline. Lower wages industry, higher wages. Okay. How is that? How does this key work? Higher wages. Where is that? How is it? Uh, yeah. Okay. I'm then trying to use this.
