 All right, so let me read the task five years after the end of the great recession in 2008, the economy regained nine million jobs at last. Each line shows the number, how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past ten years. Okay, wow. Okay, so red is recession accelerated decline and dark green is recovered and grown. So nail salons, electronic shopping and options. They're at the top, bookstores, news dealers, florists, parallel manufacturing. So these are towards the bottom. All right. So analyze the data set on economy from popular news website. Also have an individual line to bring up a more detailed chart. Type in the search bar to search industry. So you're not publishing grew support for oil and gas. So I can see that.
