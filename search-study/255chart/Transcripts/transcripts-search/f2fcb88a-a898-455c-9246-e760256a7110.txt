 Anyway, task in 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession in 2008, the economy had finally regained 9 million jobs at last. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. Our task is to analyze this data set on the economy for a popular news website. Mouse over an individual line to bring up a more detailed chart. Type in a search bar to search industry. Okay, let's see what we got here. Outpatient mental health from November 2013, 128,600 jobs. Actually, average salary 38,08 agents, managers, arts and sports promoters. January 2012, jobs 116,600 dollars, average salary 58,000, old 19. Really? I want to thought that'd been more. Oil and gas extraction. Okay, I see how this works now. Let's keep going with this. Okay, January 2004, 119,000 jobs. Well, 120,000 anyway. Then we got up 2007. It was 154,800 jobs when I averaged salary, 77,727. I peaked out in January of 2009 and it would appear at 167,000 and then dropped to November of 2010 to trough 156,900 jobs. It was lost approximately January 2009. Damn it. Sorry. 165 in January 2009 to a bottom low in February of 2010 of 156. About 9,000 jobs lost, but by 20, let's see, get up here to top. There we go. Recovered in green and that was basically April of 2014. I think 28,900 jobs were average, 78,520. Let's go down here. Some of these went down and had not recovered. Interior design services. I can understand that because my industry was one of the first that went during the crash. And I think they were two. Anything that was not, anything that was an elective or a luxury service, a ballstow in the crash, lost everything. Engineering drafting services dropped down here in the red. Sales financing still has not recovered. Wood products, general contractors, no room for 13. 300, 300, 200 jobs. DeSumbers, 300, 6, 500, 51,000. March 2014, 310, 1800 jobs. So there really was a lot of industries that had not recovered at that point. What is this? Services for the elderly and disabled really didn't get affected. Internet publishing, broadcasting, and search didn't get affected. Of course not. Electronic shopping and auctions constantly rose. For me, a luxury item would be an aid. They grew from 2004. I see up here March 2009 when it dropped. I got up to 36,800 and then dropped to 36,5. And then continued to climb all the way up to March 2014 to 62,000. Some of these were relatively unaffected. Insurance, commercial machinery was kind of affected. Auto parts, auto accessories, and higher storage of unassisted business. Nothing changed about them. Processing financial transactions didn't change. It grew with anything. Waste management. All of these are jobs that were a lot of them were necessary. Some of them were just extortion really. I see. I'd like to go to the next one and see what we have.
