Makesense people are making less money. What's this one? Oh, bookstores and news dealers. Okay, that also makes sense with the rise of, you know, people using computers. What is grown exponentially though? Electronic shopping and auctions. Okay, that makes sense. As I said before with the rise of, you know, everyday people using technology. What about this? That's interesting. Nail salons. Okay, I don't really have an explanation for that. Services for the elderly disabled. That makes sense as well because of baby boomers aging. Pet wording, grooming and training. That also makes sense because people are, I think, working now more than ever. And they need people to watch their pets for them. What about this? Internet publishing broadcast and search. That also makes sense with the rise of everyday people, pretty much everyone using the internet. Kind of fake. Support for oil and gas operations. Okay, that also makes sense. People have to drive further for work now. A lot of people are commuting like a couple hours every day or an hour every day. What is remained stable? Medical equipment, that makes sense. So, physicians make sense. Scientific research makes sense. Okay, pretty much all that makes sense. There was a little dip here which makes sense because a lot of people lost money. Okay. This makes sense as well with the rise of websites like Amazon. A lot of people are buying things online and you need warehouses to ship those things out. Did I look at this one? Yes I did. General contract. Okay, that makes sense too because of the housing crisis. So, I don't know what all of these job positions mean exactly. All right, well this one makes a lot of sense. At least in my household where I live, people don't really watch cable anymore. We just watch streaming services so it makes sense that people ordering things on from the TV is no longer really a thing. Pretty much everyone watches Netflix or Amazon and stuff. This is interesting. It kind of makes sense though that this was never really profitable because I'm sure a lot of people go to buffets and eat more than they're actually paying. Like larger amounts than they're actually paying. It's kind of funny enough that's on here though. All right. I guess people aren't doing their own home repairs anymore really. Interesting. I wonder what... I guess I don't really need to search for anything. It's pretty much all on here. You used merchandise stores as grown. That makes sense because our wages haven't increased while everything has seemingly gone more expensive. So it makes sense that people are getting more thrifty than ever. All right.
