 Okay, let's see. What am I looking at? In 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession, in 2008, the economy had finally regained the 9 million jobs it lost. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. Your task is to analyze the data set on economy from a popular news website. House over an individual line to bring up a more detailed chart type in the search bar to search history. Nail salons. Let's see. Recovered and grown from 25,000 jobs to 62,000 jobs. Services for the elderly. A sharp increase, really, to sharp increase in electronic shopping and auctions. What is that? That's like a one, two, threefold increase. That's interesting. Okay. Internet publishing and broadcasting, software publishing, computer systems and design, search for an industry. This is education or teaching. Where is education? Where is education? Where is teaching? Maybe those were not affected and maybe they're mostly flat. I don't know. Residential disability, other health and personal care, blood and organ donor banks. So what went down? Land subdivision. General contractors for new homes. Yeah. That makes sense. Bookstores and new book dealers. Way down. What is just tanked? Telecommunications reseller satellite. Okay. It looks like a lot of like blue collar kind of jobs, textile mills, kind of mechanics. I guess construction and then some business focused industries, communications, publishing. Telecommunications, real estate and the real estate makes sense. Okay. So what else do we have? What's a job that I want to know about? What is the biggest increase in recreational sports centers? Up. Modestly. I don't know. What experience? I guess the biggest increases are just the biggest increases aren't they? Right? So jobs since recession increased. Interesting. What is the, I don't understand though, what is this? Oh, higher wages, lower wage industries. Interesting. Yeah. So most of the, most of the job increase is actually in these like lower, most of the jobs that increase are lower, but most of the jobs that were decreased are in the middle somewhere, radio television cable, chemical manufacturing, interior design, water and sewer construction, building inspection, wireless telecommunications. I wonder if the total wage growth declined over this time. If more higher wage jobs declined and more lower wage jobs increased, I wonder if those, the increases were canceled out. Hmm. Recession accelerated decline has not recovered relatively unaffected. That's interesting. I mean, this one is relatively unaffected. I guess, but that's such a sharp increase. So relatively unaffected. But what about recovered? I mean, some of these don't look like they went down necessarily or like they were impacted, recovered and grown. Interesting. These ones right in the middle, right on the line, went down, came back up. So that's recovered. Okay. Got it.
