 Okay, in 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession 2008, the economy had finally regained the 9 million jobs it's lost or it lost. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. It has to be to analyze its data set on economy from a popular news website. Most over an individual line chart to bring up a more detailed chart, type in a search bar to search industry. Okay, so it looks like, florists did not do good, bookstores, parallel, manufacturing, general contractors. I think the theme here where it's interesting, like a recession is obviously going to affect and cause a decline in industries where it's a luxury. If you get laid off and maybe you're someone who's bought flowers and all of a sudden, in the floral industry, you're not going to be buying flowers anywhere so you're going to see a drop off of that. You're not going to see a need for new homes because people are going to just kind of stay in what they have. You know, even for example here, maybe like telecommunications, what do we got here, land subdivision and periodical publishers, other than like here stuff that is recovered and grown, like oil and gas, electronic shopping and auctions, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, that's an interesting one because that is more of a luxury services for the elderly. So that's really going to be a constant pet boarding is going to be a constant. You just merchandise that's interesting. Home health care is always going to be a need in oil and gas. There's always going to be a need. You know, air traffic controllers. I mean, people are always going to be flying. So that would say overall makes sense.
