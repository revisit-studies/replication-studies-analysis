 Okay. I'll do my best, but this sounds kind of complicated. It says, task in 2013, five years after the end of the gray recession in 2008, the economy had finally regained the nine million jobs it lost. Each line below represents the number of jobs, how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. Okay. Your task is to analyze this data set on the economy, on the economy from a popular news website. I don't know, like New York Times, are we talking about? I sort of feel like I've seen visualizations on the New York Times, there may be color a little bit outside the lines, but anyway. So we're gonna mouse over and so nail salons. So wait, our y-axis is decreased or increased, but what's the x? I guess I wonder why I get that the jobs increase part is high here for nail salons, but like why is it just that the scalar amount of current jobs is way lower than, oh yeah, okay. So it must be like the x-axis is number of jobs. Oh, there we go, I had to scroll down the sea. Lower wages to higher wages. Huh. Okay, wow, that's a, that's kind of complicated. So basically like, lower wage industries have been in decline since then. A lot of them at least, but not as much higher wage industries and more higher wage industries have been going up. All right, I think I kind of get it. So is there like a question?
