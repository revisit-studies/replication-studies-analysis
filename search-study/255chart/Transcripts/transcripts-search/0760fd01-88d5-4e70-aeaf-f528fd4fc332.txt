 In looking over the instructions and now in the task is in 2013, five years up to the end of the Great Recession in 2008, the economy has finally regained the 9 million jobs it lost and each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for particular industry over the past 10 years. My task is to analyze this data set on an economy from a popular news website. It looks like there are extensive number of professions that are profiled each with a grid axis showing for example the number from the point in the recession to in 2008 to 2013. Being the y axis and the axis being the wages. So for example land subdivision has not recovered. It dropped it tanked almost to zero. Being in pouring of nine metals has not recovered. Orland gas extraction has recovered. Electronics and shopping options has recovered and grown. So there's a difference between those that have recovered. Home care services were unaffected. Nail salons recovered and grown. All started pretty much at a baseline. And then either remain steady, dip and curve depending on the year or tank. There are very few that tank. It seems like most mostly they remain plateau. Or there's moderate growth in the upper medical laboratories were unaffected. I'd be interested to see how telecommunications is affected. So we're going to look for telecommunications. For wireless telecommunication carriers. I'm not pulling anything up by that. So let's find one that's already in there. Electronic repair, electronics equipment repair. Office supply and stationary stores. Natural gas distribution. Home health care we already went through. Bookstores were have accelerated to decline. So if I search for the industry bookstores and have not recovered. It outlines that one line that I previously selected. So the options are recovered and grown recovered relatively unaffected. Has not recovered or recession accelerated the decline. I believe I've gone through most of the options in each category.
