 Alrighty, so first things first, this looks like a little bit of a mess. Let's see here. So generally, it's looking like there's a trend towards the center, I guess, stability as it were only a few jobs. Hela got better, but so many more gotten worse. I can see that right there. That's the most obvious thing, but let me actually read the task that I have, which is in 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession in 2008, sorry, the economy has finally regained the nine million jobs that lost. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. My task is to analyze this data set on economy from a popular news website. Jobs since recession increased lower wages, higher wages. Such stores and news dealers. What's this? Land, sub the vision. Okay. I'm just trying to figure out what to make of all this. This is about what I would expect honestly. What's this? Electronic shopping in auctions. Hello. So you're saying that nails along is recovered and grown, but the salary is still piss poor. So, so in spite of this high salary, it has a recovery, huh?
