 In 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession in 2008, the economy had finally regained the 9 million jobs it lost. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. Your task is to analyze the data set on economy from a popular news website. So here are the jobs that have all decreased. The jobs that have all increased. I guess I kind of want to see what's the lowest one. Oh, and the green recovered and grown recovered relatively unaffected. So like, okay, I see those. Orange has not recovered. Red recession accelerated decline. And then here's the industry for lower wages and higher wages. So I guess I kind of want to look at the two extremes of like, there are already low wage jobs and also decreased. So bookstores and news dealers. Okay. So we have the years on the bottom. And then I guess the percentage on the side. Okay. So yeah, I kind of see that average salaries pretty low. Okay. This is where the recession is. I was wondering what this shaded part here was. But that's the recession. I see the five year, not five year. Whatever. Okay. So bookstores. And then I do want to see one like the higher wage that is also down here. Let's see this one. Land subdivision has not recovered. Interesting. Kind of want to end up looking at all of these, but I'm kind of looking at the extremes right now. Okay. This one's on a lot of the higher, higher wages. Computer and peripheral equipment manufacturing has not recovered. Okay. Interesting. I guess there's not an average salary for a certain amount or for a certain time period. And then after a certain time it shows the average salary. Okay. Interesting. All right. Securities and commodity contracts. Another one that has not recovered and has a pretty high salary compared to the others that have not recovered. Also kind of looking at the job count. I guess the job count doesn't really have to do with where it is on the chart. It's just the jobs since the recession. Not like the total or anything before. Okay. I'm going to look. Oh my goodness. Recovered and grown. Let's just start here for the lower wage recovered and grown. Nails along. Wow. Yeah. That industry has really been growing, I guess, compared to previously. Is this? Okay. At a certain point it's like not letting me go up. I'm trying to go to like the tallest part of this graph for nail salons and it's not letting me go beyond the little text box that says recovered and grown. And the average salary has stayed about the same or has even gone down honestly, which is kind of kind of crazy considering that it's recovered and grown yet. The salary is not really increasing. I'm going to look at this one. Electronic shopping and auctions recovered and grown. Okay. So like eBay, maybe like resellers, that kind of thing. I guess I have seen that a lot with like influencing online. But I don't really see it in terms of like people having it as a full-time job, I guess. I see people doing it more as like a side gig. Even though they have like a salary to report. So yeah, current jobs. I wonder, I'm wondering how you like report that you are an electronic shopping and auctions. Like that is your job. Like are you employed yourself or employed by a specific person, but that has had quite an increase since the recession. Let me see some that are relatively unaffected. Let's go into those. Let's see this one on the lower end. Services for the elderly and disabled. Relatively unaffected. But the jobs have increased. Wait, let me see. Okay. In terms of like recovery because it has been affected versus not affected, this industry just services for the elderly and disabled was not affected. Okay. Understood. I guess people, there are more people getting older and people are living longer in general. And again, this average salary, I feel like salaries have just kind of stayed the same even though the jobs are going way up. Let's look at one right under it. Pet boarding, grooming and training. Jobs have increased. Recovered and grown. So recovered as in it was affected. Now it has grown. This one's kind of an interesting one on the higher end that was not affected. Other professional services, translation, slash interpretation, interesting. Those jobs have grown a lot. Yeah. I'm noticing a lot of these salaries are just kind of staying the same, which is kind of interesting. We're going down a little bit. So that's interesting to know. Okay. This one's kind of on the higher end of affected and recovered or recovered and grown. Sorry. Internet publishing, broadcasting. Okay. Recovered and grown. I'm assuming is this like talking about influencing maybe? Yeah. This one has gone up a lot. This one, I mean, salary is kind of gone up. Maybe that's like not what's important to look at, but that I am interested in how a lot of the salaries just haven't grown that much. It kind of stayed the same from 2001 is it around like around 2006. Is one of a lot of the salary data becomes available and it's kind of stayed the same from 2006 to 2013. Very interesting. Okay. I'm going to look at some of the ones kind of in the middle and then I guess move on child day care services. I guess it was slightly affected, but it recovered. Job to have stayed the same. Law and garden equipment supply not is recovered. So I assume it was slightly affected. Museums. Yeah, I could see how that would be affected. Very, very interesting. General contracts for new homes has not recovered. Wow. You know, even these jobs in the markets that have not recovered and I don't know how like accurate this data is, but even some of these jobs that haven't recovered, the average salary kind of stays around the same. Did I see this one? This one kind of looks like, oh yeah, I did. The land subdivision. Oh, this one I think is what I was looking at. Earlier, mortgage and non-mortgage loan brokers, I mean, yeah, that kind of makes sense that this one was affected and hasn't recovered since that was kind of the whole reason for the great recession in 2008. Let's see, has not recovered cemeteries and creamatories, which is kind of interesting because I feel like people are still dying. And I know if you're not like being buried in a cemetery more than likely you're being cremated. So it's like, I feel like one of those industries is probably being kept in business. People haven't stopped dying. Okay. I'm going to look at one more. What is this one? Software publishers. This one's interesting. It's really on the high end of the salary and has recovered and grown, but hasn't grown that much, but has obviously one of the higher salaries. Let's look at one more. Offices of holding companies has not recovered, but so has pretty high salary compared to the others in the same category.
