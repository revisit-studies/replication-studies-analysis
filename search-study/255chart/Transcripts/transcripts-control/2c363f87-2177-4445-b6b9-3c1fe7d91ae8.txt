 going to be hard enough in 2020, 5 years after the end of the Great Recession in 2008. Okay, my taxes to analyze is that I set an account from a proper news website. So, mouse over an individual line to bring up. Okay, on furnishing stores, still has not recovered from September 2006 to the end of the six to, okay, let's check under the line. This is shitless line here first. Oil and gas pipeline construction recovered and grown. Okay, so the green lines represent those that are recovered from the Great Recession in 2008. Okay, so I get it now. So this is the average salary of people and, okay, I can also see dates there. So this is back in 2004, now it's 2007, 2009, 2010, to, yeah, so I can see how the market has really recovered. So let me check those median lines. So this has recovered but has no one grown. So it looks different from the ones that so up and the ones that bottom. So I think this one just barely is recovered. So set out the average is the chart, the green, covered in grown, covered very severely and affected as not recovered. Okay, so I'm about to check those as not recovered. Okay, plastics and rub will put up manufacturing as not recovered. Okay, looking at salary over time, it's just plummet a bit. So, okay, I think I've checked and for those days, not really been affected. Okay, I think this is recovered. Okay, so next.
