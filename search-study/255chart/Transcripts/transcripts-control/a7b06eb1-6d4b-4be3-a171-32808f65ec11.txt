 Okay, in 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession in 2008, the economy has finally regained 9 million jobs at last. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. You're tasked with analyzing this data set, okay? So is the 10 years 2013 to 2023, or is it the last 10 years, so 2015 to 2025? I can't tell. And it doesn't say on the chart. Okay. So higher wages on the right, okay? So green lines are showing recovery. Okay, I guess it's 2004 to 2013. So I'm seeing before the recession during the recession and after the recession, okay? So it's looking at it looks like number of jobs and salary. So in this case, for software publishers, recovered and grew from the recession for greens and beans. It stayed about the same. For newspaper publishers, it went down and then weighed down. For land subdivision, it still hasn't recovered, I guess. So something specific you want to meet a look at?
