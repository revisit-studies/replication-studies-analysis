 In 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession in 2008, the economy had finally regained the 9 million jobs at last. Each line below shows how the number of jobs had changed for particular industry of the past 10 years. My task is to analyze this data set on economic from Puppernos websites. Bookstores and news dealers. Looks like wood manufacturing jobs came back as well. Okay. Analyze this data set on economic economy. All right, so you're looking at jobs like the sports promoters which I don't care about, but they did quite well. But when you look at artists, okay, wholesale chemicals is very important because they used to work without chemical. It looks like it had more trouble recovering than other areas. Metal production had not recovered. Home builders. Okay, so what I'm seeing with the exception of metal or mining is that a lot of the services at arts and crafts did good, all in gas did good. Pet boarding did good. I don't understand that. But a lot of the manufacturing commercial buildings and packaging did not recover as well. I hope that's what you're looking for.
