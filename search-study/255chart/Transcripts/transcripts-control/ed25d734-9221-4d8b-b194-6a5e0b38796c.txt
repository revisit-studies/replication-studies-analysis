 So let's see in 2013, five years after the end of the gray recession, it's not me. We regained 9 million jobs. And I was at the end of the economy. So it seems like jobs in. So it looks like a lot of the jobs in like building insurance, pharmaceuticals, some retail went down. Alcoholic beverages, international market financial services all improved sports improved health care improved pet retail products improved electronics improved computer programming improves a lot of software engineering improved business and other consulting improved. And it's like half and half for insurance like some went down some went up auctioneering stayed the same transportation stayed the same. Barbershops other personal services kind of stayed the same telecom went down real big contracting building manufacturing all went down we lost a lot of jobs in a lot of the manufacturing and labor and construction markets for sure.
