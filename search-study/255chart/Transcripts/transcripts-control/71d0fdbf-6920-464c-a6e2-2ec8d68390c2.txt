 Okay, the task in 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession in 2008, the economy had finally regained the 9 million jobs it lost. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. The fourth task is to analyze this data set on economy from a popular news website, how to interact. Mouse over an individual line to bring up more details. So this is the graph. So I put my mouse over a green line and I'm seeing pet board in grooming and training. It covered and grown. The current job is 81,300. 81,300 as a 2009. It grew to, sorry, it grew to 81,300 with an average salary of 32,000. It was around 57,000 during the Great Recession. So it has grown and it recovered a lot of jobs. So let's see. The architectures industry seems to have lost more jobs. Now compared to 2008, with general contractors for new homes, they've also lost a lot of jobs. They had 400,000 jobs during the recession and right now they have just over 300,000. So they've not recovered. We've had bookstores and news dealers. They have not recovered. They were at 14,500, 900 during the Great Recession and now they are not just 90,000, losing about 45,000 jobs. So we have oil and gas extraction and doing very well. They've grown to over 200,000 jobs. We've got a lot of industries doing really, really well. Electronics doing fantastic. We've got, on average, I think the more people have gained jobs. So the chart shows how to read it. We've recovered and grown. We've recovered relatively unaffected. Has not recovered recession. As a laterated, they are declined. So I think that's just how to read the charts and I think gets the idea we have a decreased. Jobs since recession increased on the other side of the other charts. So we click the next button.
