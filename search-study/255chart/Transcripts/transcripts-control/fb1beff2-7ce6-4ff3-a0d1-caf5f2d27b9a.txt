 Okay, in 2013, five years, actually the Integrator Session 2008, the economy has finally regained nine million jobs at the cost. Each line below shows a number of jobs. How the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past ten years. And what is the data set on the economy from a popular news website? It will look so like electronic shopping and auctions has grown tremendously. That's kind of interesting. I guess that the big tech boom recently, that kind of makes sense. Internet publishing, broadcasting, research, a lot of research and publishing goes online. See what this is. Nail songs. Interesting. It looks like it grew a ton over time. Services for the elderly. Pet boarding, grooming and training. Interesting. I don't know why in that time frame, a lot of people would be getting a lot more jobs. But it's going to land subdivision. Interesting. Continue to crash, telecommunications, general contractors for new homes. I guess people were still not recovered enough financially to buy and build new homes. So that makes sense. It's kind of middle of the pack into your design, turbine power, offices of dentists. Interesting. That's gone up a little bit. Software publishers at the Center for Standard World. See, oil and gas extraction definitely gone up a big time. Other professional services have gone up like crazy. Interesting. What about this one? It's a huge dip. It's a portfolio and gas yet after crash did go crazy now to golf. Yeah.
