 why don't you, it's not going to live in another category. But,got it Plought greater Olywood crying In 2013, five years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy finally regained the 9 million jobs that lost. Shalambalo shows a number of jobs has changed for a particular industry. I'm so delighted to have you take my interest in the procession accelerated decline. Your task is to analyze this data set on economy from a popular news website. Electric shopping, nail salons. Internet publishing broadcast. It's kind of wild. I think it's kind of wild that looking at an industry where the recession is accelerated to client communications, equipment, manufacturing. And then for an industry that is recovered and grown electronic shopping in options, it's kind of wild because telecommunications is very, I would think very intricately associated with electronic shopping. I can't really say much about land subdivision. Or even, yeah, here, two of these. We have telecommunications resellers and satellite and voice over IP. And communications equipment, manufacturing, it looks like two industries where communications or where the recession accelerated the decline yet again, electronic shopping in options has recovered and grown. Internet publishing broadcasting has grown. Pretty significantly computer systems design and programming has grown. Software publishers, what is this one here? So it's just wild that there's a couple of these industries that would seem to play on each other but show kind of an opposite growth pattern after the Great Recession.
