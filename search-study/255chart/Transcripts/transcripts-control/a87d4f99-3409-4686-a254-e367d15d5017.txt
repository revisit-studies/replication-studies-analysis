 In 2013, five years after DN and a great recession in 2008, the economy had finally regained the 9 million jobs that lost each line below shows how the number of jobs have changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. Your taxes analyzed this data set on economy from a proper news website. So I'm asked over individual lines to bring up the charts. Here we got right here. It shows Nell Salons recovered in growth. So it seems that in 2004, they were pretty low, but then gradually as time went on, the increase in terms of like salary, jobs and everything. Then here we got light green. So the green recovered in growth and light green is recovered. So it seems like they are pretty stable right here. And then we have this, let's see relatively unaffected would be like kind of right right here, where it doesn't like, doesn't really have a negative or positive kind of just a stable. They don't orient right here. So we got cafeteria buffets. It has not recovered. That's still 0% and right here we have florists and this has the recession accelerated the decline. So we can see that. So it's for easy and we got all right.
