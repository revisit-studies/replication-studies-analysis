 Okay, in 2013, five years after the end of the great recession, in 2008, the economy had finally regained the 9 million jobs it lost. Each line below shows how the number of jobs has changed for a particular industry over the past 10 years. Your task is to analyze this data set on economy from a popular news website. How to interact, mouse over an individual line to bring up a more detailed chart. Okay, this is a little better. Maybe I wasn't supposed to pay as much attention on the previous page as I am to this one since I'm getting better information. So support for oil and gas operations has grown. It seems like that tends towards higher wages now. I'll bring up an example down here. Let's see, bookstores and news dealers. It seems the jobs have decreased. I'm trying to interpret the wages for the industries. I'm assuming maybe the lines that appear to the right are just indicate just generally higher wage jobs. Another line itself. Wow, this is interesting. Like I said before, it's just kind of chaotic and crazy. The way all this is displayed is hard to find any particular thing. So when I click on a line, offices of physicians relatively unaffected. Let's see. Office administration services recovered and grown. Okay, since 2004, it seems to have grown pretty considerably. I don't know since this appears further to the right. Does this mean that wages have increased along with the increase in the number of jobs? Let's see. Let's go to something over here. Building foundation and exterior contractors has not recovered. There's significantly less jobs in this industry. Average salary. So I don't know if this indicates that this is just considered a lower wage occupation or if this is indicating that the wages have actually gone down along with the decreased amount of jobs since the recession. So you get the relatively unaffected in the lighter green and then the darker green it is. The more it's recovered since the recession. Same thing below here with the red lines. It seems that if they're more orange that they haven't recovered and as they get darker red than the decline is actually accelerated since the recession. It's a monomy real confusion with this aside from just the scattered nature of trying to find any one particular occupation or industry is the wage part. So I'm assuming the lines further to the right are just considered higher wage jobs and that the line indicates just how the industry is recovered from the recession but they don't necessarily indicate whether a wage has gone up and down within that profession since the recession. So I'm going to move forward.
