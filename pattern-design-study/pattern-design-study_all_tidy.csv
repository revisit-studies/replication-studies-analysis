 You have completed the design of two charts, thanks a lot!

If the order were changed, the bars should still be distinct from eachother. For the current layout, I focused on making sure that there was never a line pattern next to a line, etc.. When a pattern must be repeated (there's only three after all), I used the different parameters to change the look so that the two repeats would not be too similar. When doing two different lines, I changed the angle and stroke width so that there are two encodings which are different. For the dots, I used dot/circle differentiation as well as density and size. For the grid, I only changed the background color. I experimented with different angles of grid lines, but those did not result in a result which felt different enough at first glance.

When I adjust the parameters, I also find it is interesting to create new pattern by flipping black and white, it allows me to use grid or circle to create new patterns. I avoid contrast because pure black vs pure white looks not good, also my background is white, so I think the white should become the basic color. I find lines are difficult to adjust, because if I give higher frequencies (density), the pattern makes me feel not good, or dizzy. I also try to make new pattern (stars,rectangles), but I find if I distort them too much, then the pattern makes me feel not good, looks like something dirty on the pie chart. For the grid, strech too much may make me feel wired, but I also need to clarify it from the existing grid, so I adjust its distort so that when I first look at the pie chart, I know that is different, although it is still a bit hard to figure out the actual shape.

If I like to give up aesthetics, I will use high contrast color. If the software is support, I may also want to adjust the color (like gray scale, but not completely black or white). Iconic patterns are easist to design, just make everything looks regular, in order. And then tweak the icon, that is done! But when I read these two pie chart, I would like the geometric one, it looks more comfortable and my brain feels not overwhelming, compare to the iconic one.

It felt like a difficult constraint to keep the shapes both visually distinct from each other, yet also readily comparable to the legend. And size felt really constrained; didn't want shapes to disappear in small slices, but also be recognizable (I think I failed the former in a lot of cases).

W.r.t. principles, ... I think I was probably relying more on different orientations for some kind of optical flow thing going on with the glyphs, that I didn't need as much for the geometric patterns?

In either case, however (especially with presumed color in everything), the minimalism of black & white could likely help with memorability, economies w.r.t. printing, and absolutely necessary for things like e-ink displays.
